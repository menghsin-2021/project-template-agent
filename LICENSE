## 授權選擇指南

### MIT License
- **適用情況**：最寬鬆的開源授權，適合大多數開源專案
- **特點**：允許商業使用、修改、分發、私人使用
- **要求**：保留版權聲明和授權聲明
- **推薦對象**：個人專案、公司開源專案、函式庫

### Apache License 2.0
- **適用情況**：企業友善的開源授權
- **特點**：提供專利保護，明確的貢獻者授權
- **要求**：保留版權、授權和變更聲明
- **推薦對象**：企業級專案、需要專利保護的專案

### GPL v3.0
- **適用情況**：強制開源的授權（Copyleft）
- **特點**：衍生作品必須以相同授權發布
- **要求**：公開原始碼、保持相同授權
- **推薦對象**：希望保持開源生態的專案

### BSD 3-Clause
- **適用情況**：學術和研究專案
- **特點**：類似 MIT 但禁止使用作者名稱做背書
- **要求**：保留版權聲明，不得使用作者名稱推廣
- **推薦對象**：學術機構、研究專案

## 商業授權考量

### 雙授權策略
考慮提供開源授權和商業授權：
- **開源版本**：使用 GPL 或 AGPL
- **商業版本**：提供更寬鬆的商業授權
- **收益模式**：商業客戶付費獲得商業授權

### 著作權轉讓
考慮是否需要貢獻者著作權轉讓：
- **CLA (Contributor License Agreement)**：貢獻者授權協議
- **著作權轉讓**：完全轉讓著作權給專案維護者
- **共同著作權**：維持共同著作權

## 第三方套件授權檢查

### 授權相容性檢查
- **MIT + Apache 2.0**：✅ 相容
- **MIT + GPL**：✅ 相容（專案變 GPL）
- **Apache 2.0 + GPL v3**：✅ 相容
- **GPL v2 + GPL v3**：❌ 不相容

### 自動化檢查工具
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "license-check": "license-checker --summary",
    "license-compliance": "license-checker --onlyAllow 'MIT;Apache-2.0;BSD-3-Clause'"
  }
}
```
